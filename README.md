# Rock Paper Scissors (Console Edition) 🎮

A lightweight, interactive console application that recreates the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. Built using **C++**, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, pseudo-random number generation, and user input validation.

## 💻 Project Overview

This application runs in a CLI (Command Line Interface) environment where the user engages in a match against the computer. The system ensures fair play and unpredictability by utilizing the system time to seed the opponent's logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Game Loop Architecture:** Implements a persistent loop structure allowing users to play multiple rounds continuously without restarting the application.
* **Randomization Engine:** Utilizes the C++ Standard Library to generate unpredictable moves for the computer opponent, ensuring every round is unique.
* **Score Tracking:** A dynamic scoring system that persists throughout the session, tracking User Wins, Computer Wins, and Draws.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling that prevents application crashes by rejecting invalid characters or out-of-bounds menu selections.
* **Win Logic:** Modular decision-making algorithms to determine the winner based on standard game rules.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++
* **Environment:** Visual Studio (MSVC)
* **Interface:** Command Line / Console
* **Concepts:** Procedural Programming, Standard I/O
